# Load and Transform Data

1. Make updates to data

2. Wrangle 6 subsets of data to answer the 6 different research questions

    1. Determine the primary factors that impact attendance intentions, media consumption intentions, and merchandise consumption intention. 
    2. Determine the factors that impact satisfaction (Performance, Outcome, Matchday Satisfaction).
    3. Determine ways to increase brand attitude.
    4. Investigate purchasing habits of corporate partner products. 
    5. Investigate ways to improve gameday experience. 
    6. Identify viable market segments

## Base EDA Step 1: Uni-variate non-graphical EDA

```{r}
# top of the dataset and look each subset
head(attendance_int)
vtable(attendance_int)

head(media_int)
vtable(media_int)

head(merch_int)
vtable(merch_int)

```

+ data appears to be tidy

    - data in each column is of the same variable type
    - no duplicate columns
    - each row is an individual's response to Reign survey
    - survey responses all uniform formatting (changed to cardinal responses and set as.numeric)
    - numeric variables and categorical
    
```{r}
# check descriptive statistics of media intentions
summary(media_int)
```

**Comments**

    - most variables seem to be right skewed since mean >> median
        - scale for most variables is -3 -> 3, so makes sense that 0 is median for many
        - right skewedness means more positive responses to survey questions
    - lots of NA's that will need to be filtered out
    
**Questions**

+ how can I gauge media intentions with these variables?

+ which variables drive media intentions?

+ which form of media is most/least popular?

    - Figure out which forms of media are most popular and assume intentions in those media forms will continue
    - Most popular media outlets will be where Reign can focus ads and promos
    
```{r}
# check descriptive statistics of merch intentions
summary(merch_int)
```

**Comments**

    - converted variables with agree/disagree character responses to numeric cardinal scale

**Questions**

+ what are the demographics of who wants to buy merch or not?

```{r}
# check descriptive statistics for attendance intentions
summary(attendance_int)
```

**Comments**

    - all variables on the scale of -3 -> 3
    - accounting for ticket cost, thoughts about Century Link vs. Starfire venue, likelihood of attendance, seating setup, buying tickets online

**Questions**

+ what are the demographics of who wants to attend matches or not?

## Base EDA Step 2: Uni-variate graphical EDA

- Examine each variable individually
- Examine how many observations in each variable

```{r}
# SOCIAL media intentions - how many times accessed per week
# Only use bar graphs (like histogram) because nothing like boxplot for categorical variables
grid.arrange(

# Website
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Website)) +
  geom_bar(),

# Facebook
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Facebook)) +
  geom_bar(), 

# Twitter
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Twitter)) +
  geom_bar(),

# Instagram
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Instagram)) + 
  geom_bar(),

# YouTube
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = YouTube)) + 
  geom_bar(),

ncol = 2 )
```

**Comments**

    - appears that the Website gets 1 hit per week is the strongest social media outlet
    - IG appears to be the weakest social media outlet
    - YouTube has some popularity
    - Twitter has spikes of interest
    - Website and FB are similar from 2+
    - Most media consumption happens on Website
    - YouTube is second most consumed media
    
+ Other social media is weak. Propose to beef up strategies around Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter
    
**Questions**

+ why is the Website getting the most hits?

+ why does YouTube getting more hits than other social media outlets?

    - Does the Reign broadcast their games on YouTube?

```{r}
# non-social media intentions
grid.arrange(

# Media9
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Media9)) +
  geom_bar(),

# Media10
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Media10)) +
  geom_bar(), 

# Media1
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Media1)) +
  geom_bar(),

# Media3
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Media3)) + 
  geom_bar(),

# Media4
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Media4)) + 
  geom_bar(),

# Media5
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Media5)) +
  geom_bar(), 

# Media6
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Media6)) +
  geom_bar(),

# Media12
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Media12)) + 
  geom_bar(),

# Media7a
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Media7a)) + 
  geom_bar(),

# Media7b
ggplot(data = media_int, mapping = aes(x = Media7b)) + 
  geom_bar(),

ncol = 2 )
```

**Comments**

    - More positive reactions than negative
    - Media4 and Media5 have most negative feelings
        - Media4: Radio ads
        - Media5: Media publicity
    - Media12 the most positively received media
        - Media12: EMAILS
        - Really??
    - Media9: Newspaper / digital sports page

**Questions**

+ Why are EMAILS the most positively received form of media?

    - Perhaps because promo codes are included in emails to get ticket discounts/special offers
    - Perhaps this is why the website is the most popular social media outlet too

```{r}
# merch intentions - 
# Only use bar graphs (like histogram) because nothing like boxplot for categorical variables
grid.arrange(

# Buymer1
ggplot(data = merch_int, mapping = aes(x = Buymer1)) +
  geom_bar(),

# Buyonl1
ggplot(data = merch_int, mapping = aes(x = Buyonl1)) +
  geom_bar(), 

# BuyMat1
ggplot(data = merch_int, mapping = aes(x = BuyMat1)) +
  geom_bar(),

# BuyStor1
ggplot(data = merch_int, mapping = aes(x = BuyStor1)) + 
  geom_bar(),

# BuySpon1
ggplot(data = merch_int, mapping = aes(x = BuySpon1)) + 
  geom_bar(),

ncol = 2 )
```

**Comments**

    - mostly positive sentiments on these questions
    - lots of people intending to buy merch in the future (Buymer1)
    - Buying merch online skewed slightly positively (Buyonl1)
        - online store doesn't seem to be enticing
    - Intentions to buy merch at match (BuyMat1)
    - Buying merch at stores only slightly skewed positively (BuyStor1)
    - Buying from sponsors heavily skewed to positive side (BuySpon1)
    - People intend to buy merch at the match (BuyMat1)
    - Most don't intend to buy merch at the store (BuyStor1)
    - People likely to purchase goods or services from sponsors rather than a non-sponsor (BuySpon1)
    - REGRESSION: lm(Buymer1 ~ BuyMat1 + BuySpon1)
    
**Questions**

+ seems like merch intentions are there

+ why do people feel this way about buying thru a sponsor?

```{r}
# merch intentions
# Only use bar graphs (like histogram) because nothing like boxplot for categorical variables
grid.arrange(

# Merimp20
ggplot(data = merch_int, mapping = aes(x = Merimp20)) +

  geom_bar(), 

# Merimp24
ggplot(data = merch_int, mapping = aes(x = Merimp24)) +
  geom_bar(),

ncol = 2 )
```

**Comments**

    - affordability very important (merimp20)
    - quality very important( merimp22)
    - convenience of retail location not so important (merimp24)

**Questions**

+ How can we pair affordability and quality to the "Buy" variables above?

```{r}
# attendance intentions
# Only use bar graphs (like histogram) because nothing like boxplot for categorical variables
grid.arrange(

# Cost3
ggplot(data = attendance_int, mapping = aes(x = Cost3)) +

# Attend17
ggplot(data = attendance_int, mapping = aes(x = Attend17)) + 
  geom_bar(),

# Seat1
ggplot(data = attendance_int, mapping = aes(x = Seat1)) + 
  geom_bar(),

# Ticket1
ggplot(data = attendance_int, mapping = aes(x = Ticket1)) + 
  geom_bar(),

ncol = 2 )
```

**Comments**

    - cost to attend is very important
    - CenturyLink field has some opposition to it, but better than Starfire
    - People don't seem to like Starfire as venue
    - People definitly intent on attending 2017 season
    - People seem to prefer general admission over assigned seating (Seat1)
    - Positive reviews of buying tickets online (Ticket1)

**Questions**

+ it seems that people prefer Century Link over Starfire, but it doesn't seem like people love Century Link. why not?

    - probably because the venue is too big
    - nobody likes paying for event parking 

+ why do people prefer general seating over assigned seating?
    
    - perhaps because there's not too many people at these games so you have the choice to sit as close as you want

**Comments**

    - It seems that the best experience is had at Memorial Stadium
        - Better than Century Link
        - Better than Starfire 
    - Propose hosting games at Memorial Stadium
    - Population seems to be happy with price point of tickets
    
## Base EDA Step 3: Multi-variate non-graphical

+ Focus on Website traffic for now since this was the most popular form of social media 

```{r}

  adorn_percentages(denominator = "all") %>% # creates proportions
  adorn_rounding(2) %>%  # round decimals
  kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")

```

**Comments**

    - 2/3 of population that access Reign website are female. 1/3 male
    - most times to access the website for both male and female is 1

**Questions**

+ I wonder how female fans are treated/marketed to compared to male fans?

```

**Comments**

    - Vast majority of website traffic comes from white people
    - Asians consist of 10% of website traffic
    
**Questions**

+ "other" has higher percentage than Native, Black, Hawaiian, and Prefer to answer. I wonder what these "other" categories are?

**Comments**

    - Most website traffic comes from straight people
    - Gay/Lesbian community make up 20% of Reign website traffic

**Questions**

+ I wonder how "die hard" the Gay/Lesbian community is compared to the Straight community?

**Comments**

    - Appears to have overall positive thoughts on performance variables
    - Higher counts on right side of 0 than on left side
    - Performance Satisfaction is high (Satperf3)
    - Excitement (Drama4), Aggression (Aggress3), Success (Success2), and Skill (Skill2) all contribute to Performance satisfaction

**Comments**

    - Most respondents identify as fans of the National Team
    - Most respondents identify as part of the Seattle Community
    - Satisfaction of Outcome is slightly positive
    - Not many people thrilled about outcome, but nobody really hated it
    - Most people are big fans of the national team (IDnattm1)
    - Most people feel part of the Seattle community (IDcomm2)
    - Perhaps variables from Performance Satisfaction?
    - Overall experience at Memorial Stadium is high (Expsat1)
    - Friendliness of Arena Staff (Prsnsat1) and Security of Arena (Prsnsat2) are highly ranked
    
    
**Questions**

+ How can a team influence outcome satisfaction?

    - If most fans identify as part of the Seattle community and as fans of the national team, perhaps getting more national team players would help drive 

+ Perhaps I should bring in demographics to this as well to see who's satisfied or not

+ Is experience better at Memorial stadium or Clink or Starfire?

    - It seems that the success of the team influences the satisfaction of the match outcome
    - Success does not have the most weight as I assumed

    - lots of NA's that will need to be filtered out

    - There is a tiny number of respondents that would hide that their association with the Reign (BIRG1)
    - Vast majority of respondents have positive sentiments toward the team and branding
    - Reign seem to be like a good team to be role models to children
    - Having the players serve as good role models to children can help improve brand attitude (RoleMod2)

**Questions**

+ how can I gauge purchasing habits with these variables?

    - If it is seen that people are more satisfied with a particular sponsor, then that sponsor should become Reign's biggest champion
    - Success from a sponsor partnership will spur interest with more sponsors
    - More sponsors will enable more fans to get involved which will lead to an increase in brand attitude
    - Partnerships with sponsors should be good for both partners

**Comments**

    - Microsoft (Spnbuy2) seems to have the most influence out of the sponsors
    - BECU (Spnbuy4) comes in second after MSFT
    - Hardrock Café (Spnbuy6), Health Warrior (Spnbuy7), and Hyatt House (Spnbuy8)- doesn't influence purchasing habits by much
    - Roughneck Scarves seems to have a decent following (Spnbuy10)
        - Probably because everyone buys scarves to wear on matchday
    - It doesn't seem that any of these sponsors have a particular amount of influence over behaviors
    
+ Kraken Congee seems to have a little more influence, possibly thanks to Reign popularity with Asian demographic

    - kraken congee is now closed as of 2021 :'(
    
**Questions**

+ What kind of "deals" would entice people to get behind a specific sponsor?

+ These sponsors aren't really that habit forming for repeat purchases from fans (other than Pepsi). It seems that the Reign need to choose different company sponsors to really influence customer behavior

    - People don't buy subarus all the time
    - People don't go to Chihuly or Hardrock Cafe more than they really have to
    - Fans probably don't need a sponsorship from Hyatt House if they go to Reign home games and they already live in Seattle

**Comments**

    - Biggest market: straight, white, females
    
**Questions**

+ what does this tell me about purchasing habits?

    - Largest market is straight white women
        - Seek sponsorships from businesses that target these types of people (perhaps something like Target!)
    - Second largest market is the Gay/Lesbian community
        - Seek sponsorships from businesses that support the gay community (perhaps something like Rudy's barbershop)

**Comments**

    - Consat2 - variety of food options - lots of negativity
    - Consat3 - Current concession offerings - lots of negativity
    - Consat8 - people seem to love the convenience of concession location
    - Prsnsat1 - friendliness of arena staff is very well received
    - Match satisfaction likely influences gameday experience (Matchsat)
    - People don't seem to mind games at Memorial stadium (Expsat1)
    - Friendliness of staff has high ratings (Prsnsat1)
    - Variety of food options (Consat2) has negative ratings.
        - Strategy to improve variety of food options would improve gameday experience. This makes sense
        - Convenience of concession location is positively received
    - Shocking to see such flat results for Location of Beer Garden (Beersat1)
        - Perhaps this makes sense since majority of fans are straight women?
        - Reign needs to put up a Spiked Seltzer garden or Rose fountain

**Comments**

    - Biggest synergies would come from Sounders and Mariners as these are the highest attended team events
    - Little support coming from SeaEvnt5 - SeaEvent9
    - Most popular game time by far is Wednesday evenings
        - This is surprising
        - I guess the Reign is a weekday activity and people don't want to spend their weekends for it?
    
**Questions**

+ What does this tell me about market segments?

    - Fans who support the Sounders and the Mariners are likely to support the Reign
    - Wednesday night games are the most popular
        - This makes it tough for families with children to go 
        
+ White, Heterosexual Females were seen as the biggest market for Reign supporters. What does this tell me?

    - Friends and boyfriends probably attend with them
    - They don't care much to drink beer in a beer garden
    - They want more variety in food options

**Comments**

    - Biggest market: straight, white, females
    - Female Reign attendees have most likely attended a Sounders game
    - More likely for a female fan to attend a Sounders game than a Mariner's game
    - Unlikely for a straight person to have attended a Mariner's game
    
**Questions**

+ what does this tell me about market segments?

    - People who are fans of the Reign are likely fans of the Sounders
        - Fans of soccer
        - REGRESSION: lm(SeaEvnt3 ~ Interest + Gender)

```{r}
# Tile graph heat map - need count
q6 %>% 
  group_by(SeaEvnt3, Gender) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(SeaEvnt3, Gender)) + 
  geom_tile(aes(fill = -count))
```

**Comments**

    - It is likely that the Female cohort also attend Sounders games

```{r}
# visualize likert data
q6 %>% 
  group_by(SeaEvnt3, SeaEvnt4) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  gather(Questions, Response, -c(n)) %>% 
  mutate(Response = as.factor(Response)) %>%  
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Questions, y = n, fill = Response)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
  coord_flip() +
    theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())
```

**Comments**

    - Majority of people feel negatively toward Variety of food (Consat2) and price point of food (Consat4)
    
**Questions**

+ What food options would people prefer to see offered at the game

```{r}
q6 %>% 
  group_by(GameTim1, GameTim2, GameTim3) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  gather(Questions, Response, -c(n)) %>% 
  mutate(Response = as.factor(Response)) %>%  
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Questions, y = n, fill = Response)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
  coord_flip() +
    theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())
```

**Comments**

    - Sunday Evenings is the most popular (Gametime=7)
